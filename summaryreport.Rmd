## Background

The objective of this study effort was to quantify spatial/temporal variability of selected water quality parameters within the Guana system. Water quality observations in this system have been very limited historically and this study aimed to develop a baseline survey of water quality conditions over a variety of seasonal conditions and a spatial gradient. Besides the spatial gradient objective, sites were selected at Mickler’s weir and either side of Guana dam to study hydrologic connections. 

Monthly water sample collections began in the Guana system in July 2017 with five sites: Micklers, Lake Middle, Lake South, River North and Guana River. This totaled to three stations in the Guana Lake and two in the Guana River. Starting in July 2018, at the conclusion of the one-year pilot study, an additional five sampling stations were added after input and additional funding from FDEP's Division of Environmental Assessment and Restoration (DEAR) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The original five stations, plus these new five stations, were then sampled for another full year (Figure 1).

The headwaters of the Guana River originate in the Diego Plains drainage area in Ponte Vedra Beach. This drainage basin encompasses approximately 7,800 acres (3,157 hectares). The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 7 miles (11.3 km) north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The natural hydrology of the Guana Tolomato Matanzas system has been somewhat altered by water control structures, including dikes, inland wells, drainage ditches and a dam across a portion of the Guana River. Guana Lake receives water from the north at Mickler’s weir and water periodically exhanges with Guana River through the Guana dam depending on water level management and tidal conditions. As such, there often is a distinct latitudinal gradient in salinity within the lake, as evident in data collected at the time of water sample collections (Figure 2).

### Methods

All samples were obtained during the same ebb tide of each sampling day and within one day of the GTMNERR monthly collections for nutrient analyses at the System-Wide Monitoring Program stations. No distinction was made between neap and spring tide conditions. All water samples were sent to ALS Environmental Labs in Jacksonville, FL for nutrient and bacterial analyses with the exception of September and December 2018 and February and May 2019, which were sent to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Central Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL. In September 2018 and February 2019, additional samples were taken and sent to Source Molecular Labs in Miami, FL for fecal source tracking. *For more specific information regarding methodology, please see the provided metadata report*. 

All of the data included in the calculations and figures below has been provisionally reviewed by GTMNERR staff. Included in the dataset are laboratory remarks, which use the FDEP lab codes, and flags, which are determined using the National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) System's Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO). The Data Management Manual can be downloaded from <http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/request-manuals/>. For any further questions, please reach out to the project’s principal investigator, Dr. Nikki Dix (Nikki.Dix@floridadep.gov).

```{r parametertable, echo = FALSE}
a <- as.data.frame(unique(dat4$component_long))
a$observation <- 1:nrow(a)
b <- as.data.frame(unique(dat4$component_short))
b$observation <- 1:nrow(b)

## Figures

The following are figures of the open water stations (not near a water control structure) in Guana Lake that would most likely be included in an assessment by FDEP. The chlorophyll *a* data presented in the figures and used in calculations of the annual geometric mean has had the pheophytin correction.
